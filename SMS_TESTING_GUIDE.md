        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACTUAL_CRON_SECRET" \
        -v
   ```

3. **Check Response:**

   - Check `sent`, `failed`, `skipped` counts

### Conversations Not Creating

1. **Check for Errors:**
   ```sql
   -- Look for constraint violations
   SELECT * FROM conversations
   WHERE client_phone = '6692456363'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

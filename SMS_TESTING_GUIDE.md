## üîç How to Check Results

### 1. Check Console Logs
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
[Deals API] Sending welcome SMS to client
[Deals API] Welcome SMS sent successfully
Running birthday messages cron for 12/25
Sent birthday message to John Doe
```

### 2. Check Database
```sql
-- View all conversations
SELECT * FROM conversations ORDER BY last_message_at DESC;

-- View all messages
SELECT
  m.*,
  c.agent_id,
  d.client_name
FROM messages m
JOIN conversations c ON m.conversation_id = c.id
JOIN deals d ON c.deal_id = d.id
ORDER BY m.sent_at DESC;

-- Check automated messages
SELECT * FROM messages WHERE metadata->>'automated' = 'true';

-- Check message types
SELECT
  metadata->>'type' as message_type,
  COUNT(*)
FROM messages
GROUP BY metadata->>'type';
```

### 3. Check SMS Dashboard
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/communications/sms
2. Should see all conversations
3. Click to view messages
4. Blue messages (right) = outbound from agent
5. White messages (left) = inbound from client
6. Automated messages show "Automated message" label
```

### 4. Check Telnyx Portal
```
1. Go to portal.telnyx.com
2. Messaging ‚Üí Message History
3. See all sent/received SMS
4. Check status and delivery info
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Message Not Sending
```bash
# Check these in order:

# 1. Is TELNYX_API_KEY set?
echo $TELNYX_API_KEY

# 2. Is agency phone configured?
SELECT phone_number FROM agencies WHERE id = 'your-agency-id';

# 3. Is client phone valid?
SELECT client_phone FROM deals WHERE id = 'your-deal-id';

# 4. Check console for errors
# Look for: "TELNYX_API_KEY is not configured"
#           "Agency phone number not configured"
```

### Conversation Not Appearing
```bash
# 1. Check if deal exists
SELECT * FROM deals WHERE id = 'your-deal-id';

# 2. Check if conversation created
SELECT * FROM conversations WHERE deal_id = 'your-deal-id';

# 3. Check if agent matches logged-in user
SELECT agent_id FROM deals WHERE id = 'your-deal-id';
```

### Webhook Not Working
```bash
# 1. Verify ngrok is running
curl https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/api/telnyx-webhook

# 2. Check webhook URL in Telnyx portal matches ngrok URL

# 3. Test webhook locally
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/telnyx-webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data":{"event_type":"message.received","payload":{"from":{"phone_number":"+15551234567"},"to":[{"phone_number":"+15559876543"}],"text":"test","id":"123"}}}'
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Testing Birthday Messages..."
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/cron/birthday-messages | jq

echo "\nTesting Lapse Reminders..."
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/cron/lapse-reminders | jq

echo "\nTesting Billing Reminders..."
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/cron/billing-reminders | jq

echo "\nDone!"
```

Save as `test-sms.sh`, make executable with `chmod +x test-sms.sh`, and run with `./test-sms.sh`

## üìù Summary of All Endpoints

```
# Manual SMS Operations (require auth)
POST   /api/sms/send                     # Send SMS to client
GET    /api/sms/conversations            # Get all conversations
GET    /api/sms/messages?conversationId= # Get messages

# Automated Cron Jobs (no auth for local testing)
GET    /api/cron/birthday-messages       # Birthday wishes
GET    /api/cron/lapse-reminders         # Lapse notifications
GET    /api/cron/billing-reminders       # Billing reminders

# Webhook (called by Telnyx)
POST   /api/telnyx-webhook               # Receive inbound SMS

# Deal Creation (triggers welcome message)
POST   /api/deals                        # Create deal (sends welcome SMS)
```

---

## ‚ú® Pro Tips

1. **Testing Without Real SMS**: Set `TELNYX_API_KEY` to empty string and check console logs - everything will run except actual SMS sending

2. **Quick Database Resets**:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM messages;
   DELETE FROM conversations;
   ```

3. **Test with Multiple Clients**: Create multiple deals with different scenarios (birthdays, lapse, billing) and run all crons at once

4. **Check Message Metadata**: All automated messages have `metadata.automated = true` and `metadata.type` set

5. **Use ngrok for Webhooks**: Essential for testing inbound messages locally
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   # Then update Telnyx webhook URL
   ```

Happy Testing! üéâ
